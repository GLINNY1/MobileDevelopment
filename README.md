# ðŸ“± Mobile Development 

This repository contains lab assignments for my **Mobile Programming** course at Fordham University. Each folder represents a different lab project, demonstrating various concepts in mobile application development using Swift and Xcode.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository
- Each lab contains only the **ContentView.swift** file.
- The rest of the project files (such as `.xcodeproj`, `AppDelegate.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`, etc.) will be generated by Xcode when you build the project.
- This is done to keep the repository clean and focused on the core SwiftUI or UIKit logic.


## NOTE 

This folder would only contain my own code and used to keep track of my development in swift programming
